# Turret Shooting Survival Game

#### Simple Description

Shoot all the zombies! (They might stop spawning)

This is a shooting game with a non-moving turret character.

Just prevent the zombies to come near you. You'll lose your life point.

#### Description

The zombies are getting hungry, and they even want to eat the brain inside of the turret (seriously? wt\*?). This turret have a great brain, because he is an artificial intelligence (Supposed to be, but he's being controlled by you).

It will take 1 zombie for them to annihilate Turry's enormous brain.

But unfortunately, because he is a turret, he can't move at all. But at least, he can rotate and blast a fire (Oh that might burn the zombies).

The number of zombies are increasing when they spawn, though, there is a maximum value of spawn. Their spawn location is random, so beware of surprise attack! He might spawn just behind you.

#### Controls

- Press 'left' key to turn anti-clockwise
- Press 'right' key to turn clockwise
- Press 'space' key to fire

Once you made sure you are using node 14, then
